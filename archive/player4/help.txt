Thank you for downloading the: BEST FLASH VIDEO PLAYER. EVER.

Included are:
	• Flash CS3 Flash File
	• Flash CS4 Flash File
	• help.pdf
	• index.html
	• movie.flv
	• thumb.jpg
	• tweenlite.as
	• mouse inactive class (com)

How to modify the file:
	To get this file working you really need not open flash at all.
	STEP 1: Embed the player.swf using either javascript or the object methods. 
	STEP 2: change the dimensions of your flash file to the same dimensions of your video/ movie file. 
	
	STEP 3: Change the poster jpg, movie file, or the players controls through the flashvars of the embed code (see help.pdf for more about that).  
	NOTE: I included the source fla files, but there is very little reason for them to be opened.

Good Luck using the file in your projects!
