					<span class="style4 style5">In one word it means Love for one another. With that love we will find Peace. UnitedHero.com has started The Peace on Earth Project. The goal is to get everyone together to make a real impact on this world. It takes money to make all of this possible so UnitedHero.com has teamed up with some large corporations that will help us if we use their tools. We have google search and amazon.com links on this site and the proceeds go to make our goals reached. Please use our google search and other links.  Please make UnitedHero.com your homepage.  Please watch all of the videos on the front page.</span>
