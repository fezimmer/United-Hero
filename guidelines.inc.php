<h2>Product Guidelines</h2>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why A Goal Amount?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking for a commitment from aggressive and dedicated Product Creators who aspire to be successful. The goal amount reflects how serious you are about your product. Harvard's Market considers ambitious goal amounts valuable on the application for acceptance.
</p><br />

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Show your passion with an inspiring video of not more than 2 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This video is your Infomercial to sell your Creative Products, it should be exciting and full of energy, explaining why your passionate about what you do and the raw materails you use to produce your work of art. What makes your products special? Sell yourself well and start your revenue stream. Upload your video to <a href="www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> or <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and share your video link on the Submission Form. Image upload is a photo of your Product(s).
</p><br />

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How much money would you like to raise?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRODUCTS will only be given a limited amount of time (<a href="#">60</a> days) on United Hero's Funding Platform to receive your goal amount. If you do not reach your product goal amount by the time allotted an additional 3% fee will be assessed. If you get support up and over your goal amount you get that money too! Price your products reasonably in your Rewards program, as overpriced and uninspired products struggle to find support. United Hero will apply a 7% fee to all funds raised, and Global Gateway will apply credit card processing fees( between 3-5%). Start building your revenue stream today!

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can your Product Supporters find out more about your Product?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be beneficial if you have a Web site, Facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php">http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php</a>), <a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, or any other sources. We recommend a Facebook Fan page. WHY? There are 850 Million People on Facebook, they also offer advertisement to bring more supporters to your landing page to sell more of your products. So start sharing and utilize your Facebook comments on your Product Landing Page with Friends and Family right away. <em>The more your page is "Liked" and "Shared" the greater your Product sales will be.</em>
</p><br />

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As a Product Creator you are ultimately responsible to direct Supporters to United Hero's Funding Platform.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You sell your Products through the Rewards Program, there are up to seven spots to fill with Products and Information in your Rewards Program on the Submission Form. Selling one product? Market that product up to seven different ways.
