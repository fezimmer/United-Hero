<h2>Dream/Project Guidelines</h2>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Show your passion with an inspiring video of not more than 3 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This video should explain the who, why, what and where.  All this means is you have a specific thing you will do with the money you are supported with.
</p><br />

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can your Dream Supporters find out more about your dream?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be beneficial if you have a web site, Facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php">http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php</a>), <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, or any other sources. We recommend A Facebook Fan page!  WHY?  'There are 750 Million People on Facebook.'  If they just gave you their 2 cents it would be Millions of dollars towards your dream, also Facebook Fan page offers advertisement to bring more supporters to your Dream.
</p><br />

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How much money would you like to raise?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a limited amount of time given to receive your goal amount. If you get support up and over your goal amount you get that money too. If you do not reach your project goal amount by the time allotted, any funds supported to your project will be refunded to the supporters. As a PROJECT CREATOR, it means that you are not expected to develop your project without essential funds.
</p><br />

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As a Project Creator you are ultimately responsible to direct supporters to United Hero&#39;s Funding Platform.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start sharing the news with your friends and family on Facebook and Twitter, they are your strongest support.
